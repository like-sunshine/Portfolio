        <p>I landed in tech entirely by accident. I fell into service/retail industry management for about a decade, less because I wanted to and more because I happened to be good at it. When I moved to Portland, I figured it was an opportunity to find a role that made a real impact on the world and started looking for non-profit work. I didn't find a non-profit to work for, but I <em>did</em> find Epicodus. I've been handling various aspects of the school's career services department ever since. As much as I love having a real, tangible impact on people's lives, somewhere along the way, I fell in love with tech too. I've messed around with HTML and CSS off an on for years and had loads of fun with it, but it's only been in the last couple of years I considered it anything more serious than a haphazard hobby. I try to always be learning something, and since I'm now done with my MBA, it seems like as good a time as any to go through the curriculum.</p>
        <p>When I'm not being a serious businessy person, I'm a pretty unrepentant geek. In my downtime I can usually be found:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Playing Dungeons an Dragons</li>
            <li>Reading comics</li>
            <li>Volunteering with a non-profit dedicated to preserving "transformative works" (That's just a fancy way fandom creations)</li>
            <li>Sewing/prop making </li>
            <li>Playing computer/video games</li>
            <li>Cosplaying at children's hospitals, conventions, etc.</li>
            <li>Hanging out with my partner, kid, and eleventy bajillion cats</li>
          </ul>
